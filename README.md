## Project Overview


**App Purpose**:
This is the NGEssence app. Its goal is to allow users access to [BBTool's](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/) BBDuk processing capabilities. BBDuk processes sequencing files (.fasta, .fastq, etc) for preparation for subsequent biogenetic analysis. After user uploads sequencing file, user may run [BBDuk](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/) against file creating a new output file. End user can then download sequencing output file (.fa, .fq).

This allows users freedom to run [BBDuk](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbduk-guide/) outside of normal circumstances such as a new computer or on a mobile device and email resulting files to themselves.


**My Goal**: Create a unique React Web App using knowledge/notes gained from Codecademy's JS FullStack path (inc. Redux Store State). Meanwhile this provides experiences navigating [MDN-Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and practice using [OpenAI's Chat GPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to assist in troubleshooting.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
